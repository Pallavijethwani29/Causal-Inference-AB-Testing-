# Causal-Inference-AB-Testing-
This project was for BUAN 6392(Causal Analytics and AB Testing) at the University of Texas at Dallas.

The question we were trying to answer was-
"Does public sentiment about a company influence political spending, and if so, how much?"

Here a simple model is built using various independent factors and sentiment data to calculate the effect using DiD, Difference of Means, and  Panel Regression. 

To run this project, run AB Testing.R in R Studio.
